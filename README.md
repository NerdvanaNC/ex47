# Exercise 47 - Automated Testing

Learning about how to write automated tests for our programs.

Will be focusing on a bit of "test first" development later on.

The book uses `nose` for tests; but that package is now deprecated, so I'm using `pytest`

`pytest` is a requirement for this module and can be found at: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest
